# Enrollment-Database
Goal:

Our goal for this project is to have an active database of all students in our college that are taking computer science classes so that our department heads can plan accordingly for the number of sections a class needs to have. There is also the prospect of advisors being able to help students plan for future classes during their undergraduate studies.

Setup:

Use google sheets to populate the classes for each student.
Write a script to create a new blank sheet for each student
Write a script to create insert statements for every class
